# Coding ninjas JS Test Super Hero App

Create a superhero hunter app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, 

### The challenge

## Features 

### Home Page
- Search any superhero from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
- Each search result of the superhero should have a favourite button, clicking on which the superhero should be added to “My favourite superheroes” (a list).
- On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

### Superhero Page
- Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, powerstats, bio (these are must, rest you can add if you want).


### My favourite superheroes Page
- Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
- Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
- Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
